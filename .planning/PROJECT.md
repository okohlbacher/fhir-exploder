# FHIR Exploder

## What This Is

A local-first React application for exploring, browsing, and auditing data on a FHIR server (Blaze). Built with Medplum React components, it provides three entry points — patient-centric browsing, generic resource exploration, and data quality auditing — with the MII Kerndatensatz as an optional navigation lens. Resolves terminology display values via the MII Terminology Server.

As of v1.3, the data quality surface is the most developed of the three entry points: it covers completeness, coding coverage, profile conformance, value set conformance, cardinality, temporal/age/duration plausibility, lab reference ranges, duplicate detection (patient matching + content hash), relational integrity (broken refs + orphans), configurable breach thresholds, trend history, PDF export, and cohort-scoped analysis — all wired through a shared drill-down pattern that links every finding back to the underlying resource detail view. Cohorts can be defined interactively (date range, condition code, reference list), programmatically (FHIRPath), or imported from the MII FDPG Codex Structured Query format.

## Core Value

Connect to a Blaze FHIR server and make its contents human-readable and navigable — from patient-level clinical views down to raw FHIR JSON — without requiring deep FHIR expertise to understand what's in there.

## Current State

**Phase 23 complete 2026-04-17** — v1.3 close-out done. 4 plans, all CLOSE-01 through CLOSE-08 closed: W1/W2/W3 code warnings fixed, I1/I2 cosmetic notes cleaned, 8 UAT items executed (6 pass, 1 code-bug fixed inline as CLOSE-08, 2 environmental deferred to MII Synthea seed), Nyquist compliance flipped on Phase 21+22 VALIDATION.md. `v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` ready to flip from `tech_debt` to `shipped-clean` via `/gsd-audit-milestone v1.3`. Test suite: 22 pre-existing failures | 717 passed. Current src size: ~35,000 LOC (TypeScript/TSX).

Quality dashboard retains its **9 tabs** with the Overview tile strip; the `/quality` toolbar now carries two peer controls — `Resource types` (renamed from the legacy "Cohort" MultiSelect) and an **Active cohort** Select that scopes all 7 analysis panels. Cohort management lives at `/quality/cohorts` with interactive builder, saved-cohorts list with three-dot Menu (Edit / Duplicate / Export / Delete), FHIRPath criterion card (Validate against live server), and toolbar Import button for MII FDPG SQ v3 JSON.

**localStorage keys** now in use: `quality.thresholds.v1`, `quality.trends.v1`, `quality.cohorts.v1`, `quality.activeCohortId.v1`, `quality.resourceTypes.v1` (migrated from legacy `quality.cohort.v1`).

## Current Milestone: v1.4 Hardening & Tech-Debt Sweep

**Goal:** Ship v1.3 cleanly (close documented warnings + human UAT), then fix the architectural drift flagged by the cross-AI code review (2026-04-16) before it compounds in future feature work.

**Target features:**
- ✓ Close v1.3 tech debt — CLOSE-01 through CLOSE-08 all resolved (Phase 23 complete)
- Data-fetching foundation — cross-mount cache for `useResourceCounts`, shared `useAsyncRun` state machine for the 4 report hooks, `Map<serverUrl>` quality cache
- Quality module dedup — `useSampleWalker` (unifies completeness + coding), `<DrillDownShell>` (collapses 5 drill-downs), `perPathExamples` in `PerTypeCoverageReport` (halves coding drill-down calls), drop `keepMounted` eager fetch, shared `SortableTh`
- App-shell dedup — `<ConnectionGatedOutlet>` for 3 layouts, `searchByIdentifierPrefix` helper, sidebar nested-route activation, `Anchor component={Link}` standardization, `SettingsContext` clean `useCallback`
- Efficiency polish — `QualityMetricsContext` re-render split, `React.lazy()` drill-down routes, `useResourceCounts` effect-dep memoization, `ResourceIssueTable` pagination memo
- Micro-consistency sweep — replace 13+ `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` sites with existing `toRecord` helper, unify en-/em-dash usage, ref-type fixes, drop now-redundant `eslint-disable`s
- Backlog UX — External FHIR validator integration (T1), OverviewStrip tile reduction 9→7 + status-line header (T2)

**Key context:** Inputs consolidated from `.planning/CODE-REVIEW-2026-04-16.md` (15 findings R1-R15), `.planning/v1.3-PLAN-DRAFT.md`, v1.3 tech-debt carry-forward (`.planning/milestones/v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`), and `.planning/todos/pending/`. Estimated ~9-10 engineering days across 7 phases (23-29).

### Out of Scope

- Write operations (creating/updating/deleting FHIR resources) — this is a read-only explorer
- User authentication/authorization for the app itself — local-only tool, no login
- SMART on FHIR launch context — not needed for direct Blaze access
- Multi-server simultaneous browsing — one server connection at a time
- Data export/ETL — focus is exploration, not extraction (quality PDF export in v1.2 is a visual report, not bulk data)
- ETL-integrated quality screening — FHIR Exploder is a browser, not an ETL tool
- Federated cohort queries (server-side CQL execution) — v1.3 shipped client-side definition only; server-side evaluation deferred
- Cohort versioning / audit history — v1.3 shipped simple create/edit/delete; no change log
- Phenotype-style multi-criteria builder with complex boolean logic — deferred beyond v1.3

## Context

- **FHIR Server:** Blaze (https://github.com/samply/blaze), running locally in a container at localhost:8080
- **UI Components:** Medplum React (`@medplum/react`) + Mantine 8 provide ResourceTable, BundleDisplay, and resource-specific rendering components
- **Type System:** `@medplum/fhirtypes` for TypeScript FHIR R4 type definitions
- **Terminology:** MII Terminology Server is publicly accessible, used for $lookup and $translate operations on CodeableConcepts
- **MII Kerndatensatz modules:** Person (Patient), Fall (Encounter), Diagnose (Condition), Prozedur (Procedure), Laborbefund (Observation), Medikation (MedicationStatement/MedicationRequest), Consent
- **Data quality theoretical foundation:** Kahn et al. framework (conformance, completeness, plausibility) as applied in Spengler (2021) "Improving Data Quality in Medical Research: A Monitoring Architecture for Clinical and Translational Data Warehouses"
- **Data scale:** Production-scale datasets (50K+ resources), so efficient FHIR search with _count, _sort, and pagination links is critical
- **Stack:** TypeScript + React 18 + Vite, Mantine 8, @mantine/charts (Recharts under the hood), jspdf + html-to-image for PDF export
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` keyed by `quality.thresholds.v1` (thresholds), `quality.trends.v1` (snapshot history), `quality.cohorts.v1` (cohorts), `quality.activeCohortId.v1`, `quality.resourceTypes.v1`
- **Current codebase:** ~35,000 LOC TypeScript/TSX, `npm run build` + `tsc -b --noEmit` both clean

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React + Vite + TypeScript with Medplum React components — chosen for FHIR-native rendering
- **Runtime**: Local-only, runs in browser against localhost or reachable FHIR server
- **FHIR version**: R4 (Blaze default, MII profiles are R4)
- **Terminology**: Must handle terminology server being unavailable gracefully (fall back to raw codes)
- **License**: MIT (see `LICENSE` at the repo root)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Medplum React for FHIR rendering | TypeScript-first, comprehensive resource components, maintained | ✓ Validated Phase 1 |
| settings.yaml for configuration | Simple file-based config, no database needed for a local tool | ✓ Validated Phase 1 |
| MII Kerndatensatz as optional lens | Users may want MII-structured OR raw FHIR views depending on task | ✓ Validated Phase 3 |
| Three auth modes (open/basic/token) | Covers common Blaze deployment configurations | ✓ Validated Phase 1 |
| Mantine-only visuals for v1.0 (no charts library) | Bundle budget (~150KB savings); Progress/RingProgress satisfy visual indicator needs | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| Dual-source profile validation (structural + optional remote) | Blaze does not implement $validate; structural walker always available, remote via user-configured validatorUrl | ✓ Validated Phase 5 |
| Sampling over full scans | 50K+ resources can OOM browser; first N per type with client-side 10..1000 clamp | ✓ Validated Phase 5 |
| PHI acknowledgment gate for remote validation | Explicit user consent before POSTing full resources to external validator | ✓ Validated Phase 7 |
| Adopted `@mantine/charts` (Recharts) in v1.2 for trends | `v1.0` constraint lifted — trend visualization requires proper charting; Mantine wrapper maintains theming cohesion | ✓ Validated Phase 19 |
| Shared `ResourceIssueTable` as drill-down primitive | Single component reused across 8+ drill-down pages keeps patterns consistent | ✓ Validated Phase 15 |
| `NormalizedIssue` type for all quality findings | Unifies completeness, coding, validation, conformance, plausibility, duplicates, references into one shape → enables cross-cutting drill-down | ✓ Validated Phase 15 |
| Pure-function quality engines + state-machine hooks | Engines testable without React; hooks manage loading/error/success state for each engine | ✓ Validated Phase 17 |
| Three-state threshold override (enabled/disabled/default) | User can explicitly disable alerting per metric, not just raise threshold | ✓ Validated Phase 18 |
| Breach coloring preserved historically in trends | When user changes a threshold, past snapshots retain their original breach state (D-11) | ✓ Validated Phase 19 |
| Off-screen React portal + html-to-image + jsPDF for PDF | Deterministic layout independent of viewport; font-readiness gate prevents race | ✓ Validated Phase 19 |
| TS2352 double-cast pattern (`as unknown as T`) | Single-cast rejected by strict mode on `unknown`-typed walker params; double-cast is the sanctioned escape hatch | ✓ Validated Phase 20 |
| Retrospective VERIFICATION.md acceptable for gap closure | When functional code satisfies requirements but formal verification was skipped at phase time, retrospective verification against existing artifacts closes the audit gap without re-execution | ✓ Validated Phase 20 |
| Discriminated-union `CohortCriterion` with `assertNever` tail | Four variants (date-range, condition-code, reference-list, fhirpath) extended without runtime type-switching; exhaustive-check surfaces missing branches at compile time | ✓ Validated Phase 22 |
| D-10 resolver cache keyed on `cohort.id + updatedAt` | Edit-with-active triggers dashboard recompute without cache poisoning; historic snapshots retain their original resolved patient sets | ✓ Validated Phase 22 |
| Legacy localStorage key migration in parent `useEffect` before child reads | `QualityLayout` mount effect runs `migrateLegacyResourceTypeKey` before any `useLocalStorage` child hook fires — prevents race where child reads old key | ✓ Validated Phase 21 |
| GET-vs-POST cutover at 40 patient IDs in `sampleResources` | URL length limits on long `patient=` param lists; switch to `POST /_search` form-urlencoded body above threshold | ✓ Validated Phase 21 |
| Medplum AST (`parseFhirPath`) + whitelisted operator/path mapping | Safe FHIRPath→FHIR search translation without string concat; `URLSearchParams` only, rejects `and`/`or`/`exists()` with precise errors | ✓ Validated Phase 22 |
| 1 MB file-size cap + field-by-field parse for FDPG JSON import | Prevents DoS via oversized payload and prototype pollution via `__proto__`/`constructor` keys — no `Object.assign` or spread on parsed input | ✓ Validated Phase 22 |
| `FileButton` + `downloadString` for cohort import/export | Browser-native file I/O with no dependencies; jsdom untestable surface captured as human UAT | ✓ Validated Phase 22 |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
