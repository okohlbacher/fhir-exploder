## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from 25 requirements across 5 categories (CONN, BRWS, PTNT, TERM, QUAL)
- Research: MedplumClient compatibility with Blaze is the critical Phase 1 risk; must validate before committing to component strategy
- [Phase 02]: URL-driven search state uses parseSearchRequest/formatSearchQuery from @medplum/core for bidirectional sync
- [Phase 02]: ExplorerLayout gates on connection status and scopes MedplumProvider to connected subtree via Outlet context
- [Phase 02]: SearchControl used with hideToolbar/hideFilters, custom filter panel and pagination built around it
- [Phase 02]: Container-level click interception for FHIR references instead of ReferenceDisplay (Pitfall 5 mitigation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 gate: MedplumClient may not work against Blaze. Fallback is custom fetch-based FHIR client (loses Medplum hook ecosystem).
- CORS: Vite dev proxy must be configured from day one for browser-to-Blaze requests.
